## 10/22/2025 - I started the majority of the research and cost of parts.  

I've started researching the hardware and software for my project and am working to identify the main limiting factors, especially the cost, since my budget is $400. The image I've provided shows my current Bill of Materials (BOM), which is still changing as I figure out the quantities of each material and how all the parts will fit and function together as one system![BOM_V1.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDM4MywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--84152ab62e65c072a4f0fdaeabbae2ecb0b6d866/BOM_V1.png)
  

## 10/23/2025 - More hardware research, as well as starting to design frame  

I’m trying to stay within budget, so I’m exploring which parts of the frame can be 3D printed and which components might not be necessary. I’ve also started modeling the frame design and testing how the spindle assembly would move and operate.![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDg3NCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--59640239f60b5cb9d39ebe255eb81d75c6aeeb2d/image.png)
  

## 10/30/2025 - Decided on a spindle, spindle driver board, and controller.  

I think that I finally found the spindle, spindle driver board, and controller. I found these on Amazon and I did some research on each of them and their compatibility with each other and they will work seamlessly with each other. The other big thing is that they all fit my requirements of keeping me within budget as well as being able to do exactly what I need them to do. My main requirements for the spindle was that it kept me within budget, it can cut thin aluminum, wood, and thin acrylic, I also wanted to be able to engrave traces and holes in copper for PCBs. Initially when I was trying to find a good controller board, I was just looking for a 3-axis stepper motor driver, but then I came across the "RATTMMOTOR 2-Axis 3-Axis GRBL Controller Board 36V DC Input, Support 300W/500W 48VDC Spindle Motor USB Port CNC Engraving Machine Control Board 32 bit with Cooling Fan for CNC Router Engraver Machine" which just so happens to be the same brand as the spindle that I found. The main thing about it that caught my eye was the price which ended up being $47. The best thing about is that is lets me connect and run my, stepper motors, spindle, limit switches, and e-stop. A couple benefits to it is that if I wanted to or someone else, they could put a laser engraver on it instead of the spindle, the other thing is a simple little controller can be plugged into the board to move the spindle and upload the files through it.![Spindle_Controller_Driver](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6Njg2MCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--f50a9abf6d08fbf4b22edf0de3c1761f038f1e46/Spindle_Controller_Driver.png)
  

## 11/2/2025 - I made some base models of the main parts

I made some base models of the Spindle, Spindle Driver and Bracket, Gantry, and Stepper Motor. I was able to find existing 3D models of the Gantry and Stepper Motor, but the rest of the main items I had to find schematics for each of the items with the dimensions and I modeled them in Onshape. I only made rough models of each of them because I am still learning to use it and I only modeled what I had to have for sure.
